# Tile-Area-Cost-Calculator
Calculates the cost to tile a room in a given room

#Instructions
Download and run in your favorite text-editor/preveiw program or browser!!

This program caluclates the total cost it will cost to tile a room, such as a kitchen or bedroom.
Enter the cost of the tile (done by $X.XX per sq foot). And the dimensions of the room!  The rooms area and total tile cost will be returned!

#Future imporvements/Fixes
In the near future I am going to add jQuery and change the formatting so it looks like cards, and you cycle through steps/phases of entering in data to the program.

I will also fix the decimal float so that the Total cost of the tile returns a maximum of 2 decimal points.
I will fix the decimal float of the area of the room so that the total area of the room returns 3 decimal points.

I also want to fix the function that allows/restricts certain characters to be inserted as an input on the textbox.  Currently, it only allows integers to be inputted, in the future I want to edit the function so that it also allows char key code = 190 which is a . (.)  That way decimal points can also be entered.

I will also add more input varibles so that different size rooms can be entered.  Not just even rectangle rooms, but also with rooms with varience in wall sizes that are not a perfect rectangle.
